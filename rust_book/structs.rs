// A struct, or structure, is a custom data type that lets you name and package together multiple
// related values that make up a meaningful group.
// Like tuples, the pieces of a struct can be different types. Unlike with tuples, you’ll name each
// piece of data so it’s clear what the values mean. As a result of these names, structs are more
// flexible than tuples: you don’t have to rely on the order of the data to specify or access the values
// of an instance.
