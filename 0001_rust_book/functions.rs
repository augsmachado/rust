    In those languages, you can write x = y = 6 and have both x and y have the value 6; that is not the

    Expressions evaluate to something and make up most of the rest of code thar you'll write in Rust. Calling
        a function is an expression. Calling a macro is an expression. The block that we use to create new scopes {},
        is an expression.
    Note he x + 1 line without a semicolon t the end, which is unlike most of the lines you've seen so far. Expressions
        not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement,
        which will then not return a value. Keep this in mind as you explore function return values and expressions next.

    Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We donâ€™t name return values, but we do declare their type after
        an arrow (->). In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the
        block of the body of a function. You can return early from a function by using the return keyword and specifying a value,
        but most functions return the last expression implicitly
